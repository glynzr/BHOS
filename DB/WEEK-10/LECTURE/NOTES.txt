TRIGGERS notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - INSERT TRIGGER
	- BEFORE : As statistic we usually get one record less as statistic. 
	- AFTER  : As statistic we usually get one record more as statistic.

 - UPDATE TRIGGER
	- BEFORE/AFTER : in both cases we get the same quantity of records.
	
	USE CASES : 'The BEFORE UPDATE' triggers go together with the 'BEFORE INSERT' triggers. 
	If any restrictions exist before inserting data, the limits should be there before updating as well.
	For example: before update check age restriction ; before update check previous and new passwords ; 

	USE CASES : The AFTER UPDATE trigger helps keep track of committed changes to data. Most often, any 
	changes after inserting information also happen after updating data. Any successful updates to the 
	age data should also update the average value of ages in newly created trigger table.

 - DELETE TRIGGER
	- BEFORE : As statistic we usually get one record more as statistic. 
	- AFTER  : As statistic we usually get one record less as statistic.
	USE CASES : usually we use for statistical purposes, archive/backup purposes!
	For example : The BEFORE DELETE trigger is useful for logging/backup any table change attempts.
	For example : AFTER DELETE. Deleting a record from the table person updates the average_age table with 
	the new average
